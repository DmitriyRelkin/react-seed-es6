# React Seed with ES6
Seed project for React. Type one command and you will spawn a server with live-reload (any change made in one of your *jsx* or *css* files will automatically reload the page where the components/css are loaded). Type another command and you will be able to build a production version with all your *jsx* and *css* files concatenated and minified.

## React + Browserify + Babel + ESLint
This seed uses Browserify to support modules, Babel to transform your *jsx* files written with ES6 features in pure Javascript (ES5), and ESLint to help you keep your code free of bugs.
