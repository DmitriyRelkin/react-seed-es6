# React Seed with ES6
Seed project for React. Type one command and you will spawn a server with live-reload (any change made in one of your *jsx* or *css* files will automatically reload the page where the components/css are loaded). Type another command and you will be able to build a production version with all your *jsx* and *css* files concatenated and minified.
